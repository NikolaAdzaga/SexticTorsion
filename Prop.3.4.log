 ================== Analyzing the simplified model ================== 
Hyperelliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^6 - 34*x^3 + 1 over Rational Field
Rank bound for the Jacobian is 0
ORDER_IS_SUBFIELD: special root
Computing isomorphism (true)
Computing its inverse (true)
true

 ================== Finding all rational points ================== 
The rational points on the original curve are: 
(0 : 0 : 1)
(0 : 1 : 0)
(-3 : -1 : 1)
(3 : -16 : 1)
(1 : 0 : 0)
(0 : 1 : 0)

 ================== Conclusion ================== 
The only points on PC for which xy is not 0 are (3,-16,1) and (-3,-1,1).
Plugging in y=-16 and y=-1 in the j-map j(E)=256(y+1)^3/y, we get that
j(E)=54000 for y=-16, and j(E)=0 for y=-1.
In both of these cases, the corresponding elliptic curve E has complex 
multiplication (CM).
